# SOM
Self organizing map implementation using Online and Batch training algorithm

4 topologies are implemeted 
1. Grid
2. Ring
3. Inner outer ring(Graph has 2 rings. Each node of a ring has a connecting edge with exactly one node of another ring.)
4. Dual ring(Graph has 2 rings. There is exactly one connecting edge between these 2 rings)
